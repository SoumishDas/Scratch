# TheNetwork

TheNetwork is a Neural Network project built from the ground up using C++.  Anyone can use this repository to understand how a neural network works on
on a fundamental level and create real life models based on this simple neural network.

The Code is written is a easy to read for format for beginners to understand how a simple Neural Network functions.

Some Example Models built using this Neural Network are also provided.

## Roadmap

- Make a simple Neural Network in C++ without any framework

- Implement Gradient Descent using derivatives for training the Model

- Integrate the Network with datasets to create real life Use Cases for the Model

- Make a chess AI using the Neural Network


## Installation

Use this Neural Network on your computer

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SoumishDas/TheNetwork.git
  cd TheNetwork

  make run
```
The Network can be further customized to suit the needs of the user and to integrate datasets.
